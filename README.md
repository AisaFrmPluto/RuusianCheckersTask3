The blue pieces move diagonally forward, one square at a time, to an adjacent dark square. The pink pieces move diagonally backward in the same manner.
Regular pieces capture by jumping over an opponent's piece, landing in an empty square immediately beyond. 
! Multiple captures can be made in a single turn if the opportunity arises !
Captured pieces are removed from the board.
When a piece reaches the last row of the opponent's side, it is crowned as a Dame. 
A Dame can move and capture both forward and backward.
The game ends when one player has no legal moves remaining.
The player with remaining pieces wins the game.

Players take turns making moves.
